* Talk for my PhD defense


1. Introduction metaphysics and how that can lead to the axion
2. Axion? Ah, can produce in the Sun!
3. Expected axion spectrum, blackbody similar
4. Helioscope experiments, example CAST
5. Show our setup at CAST, data taking there. What kind of detector?
6. Show exploded detector. Focus on GridPix functionality (slides
   showing detection we once created), and Septemboard. Other detector
   features only name them.
7. X-ray telescope! Creates image of axions! Small enough to fit on
   center chip! Show expected axion image
8. GridPix function: Can deduce expectation of signals!
   - low axion rate: background dominant
9. Try to find signal in tracking dataset! 
10. Biggest question: how find little signal in dataset?
11. Classifier needed: past used likelihood, now simple 2 layer MLP!
12. All know machine learning needs lots of data:
    - simulate X-ray events. Monte Carlo fun!
    - Background data of outer chips! Not needed for physics limit!
13. Verification based on CDL and 55Fe data
14. What happens if applied to center chip?
15. Septem veto! Show schematic from thesis what idea is!
    - improvement single -> septem full chip clusters or suppression
16. Have background. Can extract candidates.
17. Compute a limit! Quick (!) intro Bayesian unbinned likelihood
    method
18. Inclusion of systematics via nuisance parameters -> expensive
    evaluation. MCMC for rescue. MCMC example
19. Background interpolation and candidate sampling (& expected limits)
20. Mention signal inputs
21. Mention evaluated different setups etc, focus on best one. Show
    expected & observed limit
22. Method fully generic, also computed limits for axion-photon &
    chameleon.
23. Result presented, but not done: Something very important to me,
    reproducibility in science. Made sure all results reproducible,
    i.e. data and plots in theses have code snippets / commands
    associated with them, plots made available. Also as CSV for all
    plots other people can reproduce them / include them. All code
    made available. All data made available.
24. If you are physicist and only take one thing from my presentation,
    please focus on allowing your results to be reproducible. Not only
    for other people, but also 'future you'!
25. Summary and thank you.
