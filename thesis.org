* Introduction

* About this thesis (structure)

Explanation about the thesis structure and introduction of the "full
thesis document".

The thesis you are reading right now is a shortened version of the
full document it is part of. To conform to the expectations of a PhD
thesis many parts are removed that are irrelevant for the basic
presentation of the work done during the thesis.

However, a fellow researcher who wishes to understand all the details,
in particular in terms of reproducibility of the results, the full
document should be read instead.

The full document is found at:

*TODO*: insert link, probably to GitHub as well as some other source

The main difference between the regular thesis document and the
extended version are the following. The extended version contains:
- either inline code or links to the code that produces *every plot*
  (that is created by me); inline code is used if the required code to
  generate the plot is less than a certain amount of lines.
  For non-inlined code the used code is referenced (link to the code +
  correct git commit)
- access to *all* raw and reconstructed data to reproduce the results
- additional chapters that were not relevant enough / polished enough
  for inclusion into the thesis. This includes additional plots,
  investigations of detector behavior etc., theoretical calculations
  and more.

In essence the idea is to provide a fully reproducible thesis. The
extended version should ideally be read as a mix of the generated PDF
and the real Org file behind it.

The extended version includes many source code blocks that can be
extracted using [[https://github.com/OrgTangle/ntangle][ntangle]]:
#+begin_src sh
ntangle thesis.org
#+end_src

Ideally, all results can be reproduced with a single:
#+begin_src sh
./generateResults.sh
#+end_src
call (we'll see how that will work out).

The package versions for the code used in the extended version will be
frozen at a specific time. The list of version numbers will be found
below.

*TODO*: Add version numbers of all packages used for final plots.

*TODO*: Have specific marking in (sub)sections if they contain more
information in extended version?

* TODO List of todos [0/2]

** TODO Have reference to Firmware used at CAST in each run

** TODO Run list (appendix)

** TODO Include exact results from Geometer measurements

Find in EDH and include, even if we don't use it. Referenced in X-ray
finger measurements.

* Theory of axions

** Historical origins

** Strong CP violation

Use the schematic I created for Hendrik's presentation?

** Peccei-Quinn solution

** DFSZ & KSVZ axion models

** Solar axion flux

*** Primakoff flux

Including analytical equation for flux... :)

*** Axion-electron flux

*citations*: Redondo 2013, maybe (Johanna + Sebastian Hoof something?)

Expected axion flux combined.

Reference to file storing the results for specific coupling constants.

** TODO possibly add chameleons?

** Current bounds on axion couplings

Astronomical axion bounds.

Cavity bounds.

Helioscope bounds.

(what else?)

*TODO*: include newest Chandra results for coupling constant

* Axion helioscopes

** TODO small section about other kinds of experiment?

** CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST)

Basic data.

Data taking periods.

** International AXion Observatory (IAXO)

*** BabyIAXO

* Gaseous detectors principles

** MicroMegas working principle

Take my own sketch and fix it up.

** Timepix ASIC

Introduce Timepix. Short introduction to how they are built?

** Christoph detector as example of simple 

* Septemboard detector


** TODO Render done by Tobi. Exploded view.

** Scintillator vetoes

** FADC

** TODO schematic of whole readout chain

Create a full flow chart of how everything is connected.

We have our notes about where each cable goes etc.

* Detector preparation / study / characterization etc.

** CAST Detector Lab

Measurements for X-ray reference data

Detector lab measurements were only performed after the data taking
period at CAST was over. From a logical standpoint it makes more sense
to talk about it before though.

* Detector installation at CAST

** Lead shielding at CAST 

** Installation & setup

Use detector documentation written for CERN (Thank fucking god I had
to write this back then).

** X-ray finger runs

** Issues etc. during data taking period

Noise issues, scintillators not working in Run 2.

** Run 2 and Run 3

Different detector calibrations in each run.
