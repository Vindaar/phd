<p>
The Standard Model of particle physics (SM) is extremely successful at
describing three out of the four known fundamental forces of
nature. However, there are several open questions even within the
SM. One of those is termed the 'strong CP problem'. In a simplified
way it asks why the neutron does not have an electric dipole
moment. While only a mathematical problem of sorts, it can be neatly
solved by the introduction of a new hypothetical particle, the
<i>axion</i>. This particle can interact with photons and leptons, even if
extremely feebly. If they exist, they will be produced in the 
core of the Sun at very high rates, but easily escape similar to
neutrinos. On the Earth we can attempt to detect them using strong
magnetic fields. The latest such experiment, a solar helioscope, is
the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST). Axions carry the energy of the
photons, which initially produced them, placing them in the soft X-ray
energy range.
</p>

<p>
In the course of this thesis, a gaseous detector using 7-GridPixes as
its readout was deployed at the CAST experiment in 2017/18 to follow
up on previous measurements with a single GridPix detector in
2014/15. \(\SI{3150}{h}\) of background data and \(\SI{160}{h}\) of solar
tracking data was taken. The data taken at such an experiment is
dominated by cosmic radiation, radioactive background and X-ray
fluorescence. As such methods to suppress this background and extract
the few possible axion signals are needed. A software library
<code>TimepixAnalysis</code> was developed in the course of this thesis to
reconstruct and analyze the data taken at CAST.
</p>

<p>
For the classification of event data into background-like or
signal-like (X-ray) data, a machine learning approach is used. A
multilayer perceptron (MLP, simple type of an artificial neural
network) was trained on synthetic X-ray data and CAST background data
of 6 of the 7 chips (leaving out the chip sensitive to axions). This
method significantly improves the signal efficiency at comparable
background rates, when compared to the likelihood cut method used for
the old detector.
</p>

<p>
Further, as no excess signal was detected in the solar tracking
dataset, a limit calculation method was developed. This method builds on the
unbinned Bayesian likelihood method used in CAST's Nature paper
in 2017. It is extended to allow the inclusion of systematic
uncertainties as nuisance parameters. Due to the very expensive
evaluation of such a likelihood function, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) approach is used.
</p>

<p>
One of the limit calculation inputs is the 'axion image' produced by
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) telescope at
CAST. To properly characterize this, a raytracing simulation taking
into account the axion production rates in the Sun and reflection
through the X-ray optic was developed. It was verified against
PANTER measurements of the telescope.
</p>

<p>
With the software advances and improved detector features, world best
limits could be set on the axion-electron coupling and on the
chameleon coupling (a separate hypothetical particle). The previous
best limit on the axion-electron coupling is improved from
\(g_{ae}·g_{aγ} \lesssim \SI{8.1e-23}{GeV⁻¹}\) to \(g_{ae}·g_{aγ}
\lesssim \SI{7.35e-23}{GeV⁻¹}\) and the chameleon coupling from \(β_γ <
\num{5.74e10}\) to \(β_γ \lesssim \num{3.1e+10}\).
</p>

<p>
In addition, the software developed during the course of this thesis
was written with future detectors in mind. It is in principle ready
for data analysis for a GridPix3 based future detector.

One of the most important parts for my thesis has always been being
able to replicate results. Part of that is providing access to my
data, including the raw data taken with our detector at CAST.

files can be found on <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a>:

The results in the thesis were all produced with the git tag

reproducibility. Once the final thesis is published I'll create a

<p>
There are 2 major files potentially of interest to the kind of reader
who may stumble on this website.
</p>

<p>
The first is a sort-of journal I wrote over the years. It was used
more as a day-to-day journal in 2023 and contains some other
'journaley' notes from before.
</p>

<p>
The second is my "status and progress" type document. It contains a
large amount of notes related to all sorts of researching ideas /
results etc. Almost all things that ended up in the thesis were
written at one point or another in one of the two documents. So they
may be worthwhile to look into.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The 'journal':
<a href="http://files.vindaar.de/journal/journal.html">http://files.vindaar.de/journal/journal.html</a></li>
<li>The status and progress notes:
<a href="http://files.vindaar.de/status/StatusAndProgress.html">http://files.vindaar.de/status/StatusAndProgress.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that both of these documents are very large. At least on my
laptop running Brave these two pages are no fun. Firefox however deals
with them very well. I'll probably end up splitting them into
different pages at some point. But if you are more seriously
interested in them, I recommend downloading the Org file of the
document (just replace the <code>.html</code> ending by <code>.org</code>; note: currently
not available for the <code>journal</code>, because I use that journal for stuff
unrelated to the PhD as well and I haven't produced a standalone Org
file without those&#x2026;).
</p>

<p>
Aside from these, another 2 files may be of interest:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The calculations related to a possible gas phase for (Baby)IAXO:
<a href="http://files.vindaar.de/phd/docs/bufferGasIAXO/v1/axionMass.html">http://files.vindaar.de/phd/docs/bufferGasIAXO/v1/axionMass.html</a>
or
<a href="http://files.vindaar.de/phd/docs/bufferGasIAXO/v1/index.html">http://files.vindaar.de/phd/docs/bufferGasIAXO/v1/index.html</a></li>
<li>The original document of the notes containing the calculation of the
median and mean conversion point of axions from the Sun in our detector:
<a href="http://files.vindaar.de/phd/docs/SolarAxionConversionPoint/axion_conversion_point.html">http://files.vindaar.de/phd/docs/SolarAxionConversionPoint/axion_conversion_point.html</a>  
These are almost identical to the appendix about the same in the thesis.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A few other documents exist that I might upload at some other time
(related to the LLNL telescope, raytracing etc.). These are mostly
already contained in some form or another in the above though. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org48e22d0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org48e22d0"><span class="section-number-3">1.6.</span> Note about TLS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">
<p>
This main page is hosted on Github using Github Pages. But all the
linked pages mentioned in the section above are just files publicly
linked on Backblaze B2. I might migrate them elsewhere at some point
to support TLS there too, but as all the plots alone sum up to almost
1GB of data, I'm not sure where at the moment.
</p>

<p>
But then again, who cares for this kind of stuff?
